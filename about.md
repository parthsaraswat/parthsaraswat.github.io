I'm Parth, a Master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Cornell University. I have a deep interest in computer architecture and the computer engineering stack.

I'm about to start working as a hardware engineer in Massachussets. 

------------------

When I'm not working on meeting deadlines, I'm either working on [side projects](/projects), reading, making YouTube videos, or trying to record some music.

Here's some of what I'm doing these days:
- **Current Academic Side Project:** Branch Predictors!
- **Current Non-Academic Side Project:** Learning how to build static websites (like this one which I built using Jekyll!)
- **Currently Reading**: _Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt
- **Currently living** in Ithaca, NY.
