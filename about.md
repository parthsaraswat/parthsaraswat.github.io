I'm Parth, a Master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Cornell University. I have a deep interest in computer architecture and the computer engineering stack.

I'm about to start working as a hardware engineer in Massachussets. 

------------------

When I'm not working on meeting deadlines, I'm either working on [side projects](/projects), reading, making YouTube videos, or trying to record some music. 

---------------------
Here's some of what I'm doing these days:
- **Current Academic Side Project:** Combining computer architecture and functional programming
- **Current Non-Academic Side Project:** [Learning a new skill every week](https://parthsaraswat.github.io/general/2020/06/06/lsnew.html)
- **Currently Reading**: _A Fine Balance_ by Rohinton Mistry
- **Currently living** in Ithaca, NY.
