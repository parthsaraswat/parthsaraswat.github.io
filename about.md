I'm Parth, a Master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Cornell University. I have a deep interest in computer architecture and the computer engineering stack.

I work as a hardware engineer in Massachussets.

When I'm not working on meeting deadlines, I'm either working on [side projects](/projects), reading, making YouTube videos, or trying to record some music.

Here's some of what I'm doing these days:
- I just released a podcast with my friend. You can find it [here!](http://frndshiptime.com)
- **Currently Reading**: _A Promised Land_ by Barack Obama. Find my Goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18742914-parth).
- **Currently living** in San Francisco.
