I'm Parth, a Master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Cornell University. I have a deep interest in computer architecture and the computer engineering stack.

I work as a hardware engineer in Massachussets.

------------------

When I'm not working on meeting deadlines, I'm either working on [side projects](/projects), reading, making YouTube videos, or trying to record some music. 

---------------------
Here's some of what I'm doing these days:
- **Current Academic Side Project:** Combining computer architecture and functional programming
- **Current Non-Academic Side Project:** Covering 1 Song every Week
- **Currently Reading**: _Grit_ by Angela Duckworth. Find my Goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18742914-parth).
- **Currently living** in New Jersey.
