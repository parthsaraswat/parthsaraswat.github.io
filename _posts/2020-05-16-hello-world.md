## Hey visitor! :wave:
### Thanks for visiting my website! This is my first post, and I want to outline what I'm trying to achieve with this website. 

As I get closer and closer to finishing up my Master's degree, I want to ensure I keep learning new things and continue to keep the momentum that Cornell has helped me achieve over the past year.

I want this website to be a catch-all landing page for anything and everything that I make and put on the internet. For instance, I want to use the website to be a home to:
- **a blog** where I can dump some of my thoughts from week to week 
- **all my academic and side projects**, including source code and documentation
- **my YouTube exploits once I get my channel back up and running**, which may be never (but I'm optimistic)
- **anything else** that I end up making/working on that doesn't fall under the other categories

I'm excited for what the future holds :)
