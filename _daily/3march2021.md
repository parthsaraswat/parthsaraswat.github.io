### Writing
**What comes next:**
- blog post to support podcast ep

### Music
**What I did:**
- normal practice routine with extra focus on improv

**What comes next:**
- final mix for WL5 
- FSheet for WL5
- improv with some more context: what chords are we playing over? What notes should I choose? Some patterns to find notes quickly

**What I learnt:**
- more pattern recognition
- switching from one pattern system to another while improvising

**What I struggled with:**
- arpeggios and note selection and patterns. It's now time for more info: youtube, here I come. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- started ep 11 edit
- determined how to split into 2 eps

**What comes next:**
- head down and edit

**What I learnt:**
- hosting observations. Have to be a little more freeform in thought, maybe listen to more NSQ and T&Los to see how to do better here.
