### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- started episode 35 edit (part 1)

**What comes next:**
- add audio cues & clean up sections. finish edit tomorrow

**What I learnt:**
 - *Conceptualization*
     - this idea was pretty cool and fun
     - usually we do these 'value' or 'reflection' episodes but I'm slowly trying to transition into more alternate formats. the classic format is almost a fallback if i'm unable to come up with something more fun or creative
 - *Hosting*
     - from what I heard today, things were okay. we gave each other our space. I think we've got it now. it's all ingrained and we know how we work. The only way I imagine I can add something here is to start to remix how COB does his episodes/tom segura does his stand ups.
 - *Editing*
    - lofi in the background is a very solid hack! editing also need not take too long at all. I could have finished the episode today if I really wanted.
