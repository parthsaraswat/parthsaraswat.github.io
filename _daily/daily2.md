### What I did:

#### Writing
- Began writing the post for next week - it's about my writing process!

#### Music
- Recorded the vocals for my Somewhere Only We Know cover (I'm not a singer)

#### Technical
- Finally enabled sitewide commments using Disqus! The problem was with properly naming the site as a 'trusted domain' on the Disqus dashboard. My bad. You can now leave a comment on any post sitewide! <3

### What I struggled with:
- As much as I like to sing, I'm not very good. What seems like a good take ends up being terrible 45 minutes later
- Help me out with singing if you can!
