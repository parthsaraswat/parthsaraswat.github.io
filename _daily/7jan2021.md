### Writing

**What I did:** 
- initial ideas for next week's post

**What comes next:**
- coherent structure and flow

**What I struggled with:**
- too many ideas, have to realise that a post that is supposed to take a week can only have so much scope.

**What I learnt:**
- have to answer [certain qs](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s218/nl/27093707/03323db4-0c41-ebd4-2371-ee58ae74a4ab?title=Qs%20to%20answer%20for%20each%20blog%20post) to have the best start to a post

### Music

**What I did:**
- revised practice routine
- decided on 3rd instrument
- decided on a concrete rhythm for the guitar

**What comes next:**
- lock down base tones for 3/9 trax
- more iterations to practice routine + grow lick library
- practice and record intro through c1 on trax 1, 2, maybe 3

**What I struggled with:**
- put gear first and got lost in playing

**What I learnt:**
- Limit your scope and choices to get things shipped and done
- you cannot keep ruminating or you will never finish
- gear second, ideas first
