### Writing
**What I did:** 
- finished written outline for post 1 of series

**What comes next:**
- type out outline, polish
- start thinking about illustration options?
- flesh out documentation for post 2?

**What I learnt:**
- for some reason, I let things be more difficult than they are. I had the outline written out quite quickly but kept going back trying to tweak it or thinking it wasn't done just because I hadn't struggled too much with it. It's probably a good hting if the process goes smoothly, it allows me to do this over and over again aconsistently

**What I struggled with:**
- not much.

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- edited and uploaded ep 33

**What comes next:**
- social post for 33

**What I learnt:**
- my fastest edit yet (?)
- sushi episodes is a real thing


 - *Conceptualization*
     - the idea for 33 was easy, good, and a classic
     - we seem to have the craft of choosing a good classic idea down
     - coming up with more alternative episodes and trying those out is on the list
 - *Hosting*
     - there is such thing as prep & delivery
     - constraint and clarity are highly appreciated
     - 
 - *Editing*
     - classics are so easy to edit
     - need more ideas for special editing - esp s2. Listen to more podcasts and make a running list of editing ideas?

### Content I consumed
1. Anything You Want by DSivers
2. A bunch of random articles

**What I learned:**
- really varied things from AYW
