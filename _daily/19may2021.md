### Writing

**What I did:** 
- scoping out next post

**What comes next:**
- concretize and populate the scope and outline

**What I learnt:**
- I'm trying a new storytelling format with visuals and a set structure. Clarity -> fear -> clarity. Let's see how that works out

**What I will try next time:**
- 1-2 hours is enough to come up with an outline and main post. I spent far too much time on this post

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- edited and uploaded bonus episode

**What comes next:**
- release tomorrow
- start episode 21 edit

**What I learnt:**
- edits are slowly becoming very easy and very quick. This means I now have more time to spend on newer ideas for formats, newer forms of audio storytelling, etc. 

**What I will try next time:**
- trailer for episode 21: "this week on Frndship Time!"
- maybe useful for social media and as a quick taster?
