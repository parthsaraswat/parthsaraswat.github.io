### Writing
**What I did:** 
- drafted first post of series
- mostly conceptualised second post - it needs one more go through

**What comes next:**
- begin illustrating post 1
- outline post 2

**What I struggled with:**
- not much... I think I might have reduced my standards for my writing? I'm relatively content with the post being relatively crisp. It does lack humor - but that might be something I can use the illstrns for

**What I learnt:**
- most of writing these kinds of posts is thinking. Doing pmeds has helped me 'write' posts in my head within a matter of half an hour. The actual act of sitting down and typing them out is just a boring part of the job at this point. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- new idea for a special episode. As noted, stepping away from the classical episodes is my next target for now. 
- conceptualised ep 35

**What comes next:**
- social post and release ep 33

**What I learnt:**
 - *Conceptualization*
   - think fast, and commit to ideas. don't overthink how good something could be. 

 - *Hosting*
   - I saw a bunch of Tom Segura today. He is, of course, naturally hilarious. I want to incorporate bits like his and COBrien's into the show. Relying on our own ability to 'be funny' is both: comfortable and subpar. Neither of which i'm okay with.
