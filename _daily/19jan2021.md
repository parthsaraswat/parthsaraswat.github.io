### Music

**What I did:**
- arranged entire loop
- composed and tracked 4 layers

**What comes next:**
- playing around with solo
- make sure to _'jump into it'_ rather than a cold start

- arranging things that didn't exactly follow the CP -- everything was _too_ diatonic. Sounded good, but lacks adventurous melodies

**What I did:**

**What comes next:**
- start cleaning sections

**What I learnt:**
- color your regions! visually separating regions can help so much when it comes to final clean ups and edits.
