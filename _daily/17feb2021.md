Back from a break. 

### Writing
**What I did:** 
- outlined next post

**What comes next:**
- type out final post, add illustrations

**What I learnt:**
- the process of writing has become internalized at this point. I think I can start to skip certain parts of the process: it's important for me to remember that I don't write professionally, but because it's fun and helps me crystallize any thoughts -- there is no point to write with such a clunky process. 

### Music
**What I did:**
- finalized guitar solo tone for WL4
- finished backing track
- recorded first 36-ish bars of solo

**What comes next:**
- practice solo licks when doing nothing else
- technique, speed, and basic improv practice. lead playing is by far the weakest link of the loops

**What I learnt:**
- compartmentalize, and commit
- time constraints are good, and focus on ONE PART is also good

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- recorded episode 10
- started edit on episode 9. this one is going to be a tough one

### Other
**What I did:**
- ...cut my hair
- some admin stuff
- templating and thinking. imagine that. I just put 'thinking' on my daily dispatch. this page is officially a joke now.
