### Writing
**What I did:** 
- typed out outline for post 1 of series
- began fleshing out post 2

**What comes next:**
- polishing outline into first draft
- full list of illustrations

**What I struggled with:**
- I have very little 'intuitive writing' sense in me now. It could just be the topic I'm working with but for now it lacks snappiness and humor. I'm okay with this, though - things must go out there even if they're lacking. Newer versions will get better.

**What I learnt:**
- Typing an outline out is much easier after having handwritten the whole thing. Also reminding myself to not make things tougher than they need to be.
