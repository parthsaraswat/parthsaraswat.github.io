  - edited episode 37 - one sitting job
  - nag people for Qs

**What comes next:**
  - start prep for 39 and 41

### Content I consumed

1. Kota Factory S2E3 - really great series, surprisingly 'life-lessons-'ey

**What I learned:**
  - you don't need mastery in order to produce things
  - you start with what you have and where you are, and work towards mastery with execution and experience
