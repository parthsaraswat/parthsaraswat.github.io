### Writing

**What I did:** 
- mind dumped out another post

that's 2 posts in the timeline now! oh boy. that's a first. 

**What comes next:**
- an outline

**What I struggled with:**
- there is so much to talk about but only so much time and so much space in a blog post. Managing and understanding scope is huge

### Music

**What I did:**
- scratch rhythm track

**What comes next:**

- lock down base tones for 3/9 trax
- more iterations to practice routine + grow lick library

**Other thoughts:**
- putting too much pressure on one project is very limiting
- turn down the pressure - the release doesn't have to be a huge thing and neither does it have to be a perfect thing -- a simple bandcamp/soundcloud track is just as fun, and maybe more valuable in the long run
- you can iterate over one of those releases
- maybe i can use weekends as 'loop challenges'
  - pick a chord progression
  - write, record, and put together a full loop track
  - do it every week
- the goal being that it acts as a 'weekly output' for music the way the blog and podcast act as weekly outputs for their sectors
- more practice = get better
