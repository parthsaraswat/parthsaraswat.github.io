### Writing
**What I did:** 
**What comes next:**
**What I struggled with:**

### Music

**What I did:**
- _tried_ to arrange a solo for a loop, it didn't work!
- nothing worked, maybe for one of 2 reasons:
  1. i am just bad
  2. the current 'playful' vibe of the loop just doesn't work with any solo

my best guess: it was a bit of both

**What comes next:**
- try with experimental tones
- try playful rhythms on the solo
- if nothing works, scrap solo and flesh out remaining loop in some other way

**What I struggled with:**
- not being able to capture the direction of the loop in the solo -- resulting in nothing working!!! F.

**What I did:** 
- finished episode 5 edit! the final thing. signed, sealed, delivered. other ways to say it is ODNE. still over a week away from upload date.

**What comes next:**
- plan ep 7
- i have some free time now that this is done, time to use it for other stuff.
