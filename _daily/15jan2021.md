- this was my first instalment of a weekly loop, next week we do one more. Some thoughts:
  1. This is a very fun exercise in... everything. Very end-to-end
  2. In order to get the most out of it & improve, I have to point out exact things that need improvement and _practice_ them separately (outside of weekly loop time)
- Here's what i'm thinking of adding and changing:
  - Technique
    - **get rid of sloppy playing** -- the only way this will happen is w practice
    - timing issues
  - Arrangement
    - more of PD & SG tricks for layering and arrangement
  - Solo
    - very stuck in the first 2 pent boxes + EBG strings
    - need to pay attention to harmonic choices
    - use 'slinky' licks and adopt [concepts](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s218/nl/27093707/2a3db391-905b-45a3-9e77-59161164e036?title=Lead%20concepts) into licks
    - pay more attention to how to [jump into solos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cykvGQZDkXI&list=WL&index=31)
    - use premade licks -- coming up with your own licks will leave you in a funk -- you will get stuck in your tendencies (STOP USING SIXTHS!!!)
  - Production
    - try using [strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbtPIfwuJ0E&list=WL&index=7)
    - save a day for mixing?
    - use buses & sends
