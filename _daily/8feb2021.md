### Writing

**What I did:** 
- started new post for this week. working on mini versions of posts with time constraints. [quantity beats quality](https://psaraswat.com/2021/01/12/qvq.html) ;)

**What comes next:**
- mind map the post. list out illustrations and get started with outlining

**What I struggled with:**
- as convenient as working with a computer is, paper and pen is just better during the early stages of a post. Going to stick to trusty old ink next week onwards. 

### Music

**What I did:**
- some 1-4 shape study and improv
- fill out template for WL4

**What comes next:**
- recording main CP
- drum machine tricks

**What I struggled with:**
- just not enough time to get technique practice in
- am i really getting any better at _playing_? not quite sure. the approach now is to cut out 'talent simulators' in covering up lack of skill using vsts and helper fx. this track is going ot be an honest reflection of ability. I'm foreshadowing a shitty track here, but hopefully it can bring me back to reality and how much work is left to be done in order to get to an actually useful level. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- finished up episode 7 edit

**What comes next:**
- final channel fx and bounce

**What I struggled with**
- I wouldn't call this a struggle, but things are getting faster and better at this point. The opposite of a problem, yes, but it means I now have _slightly_ more bandwidth to get more creative with some of the things I can do on an edit/conception of an episode/social media posting, etc. Just something to be aware of. I'm not a fan of getting too comfortable. I think within another episode or 2, I need to add something exciting to push the quality of the edits and the show itself. R, if you're reading, remind me to talk to you about this lol.
