### Music
**What I did:**
- normal practice schedule + improv
- recorded main CP and a few more layers of WL5 (i would share, but this one is a secret)
- dialed in final tone

**What comes next:**
- other layers
- arrangement
- improv with some more context: what chords are we playing over? What notes should I choose? Some patterns to find notes quickly

**What I learnt:**

*Technique*
- Timing: move your foot and body to lock into the groove. Don't play by feel, reactively listen to the click, dial into it, and keep going
- to mute thicker strings, use the pad of your right hand. to mute thinner strings, use the left hand

*Pattern recognition*
- Relative major: b3rd of root
- Relative minor: 6th
- 4th is always just fret below root (quick location)

**What I struggled with:**
- the improv solo was actually okay, but when I jump onto the top strings, I get stuck there and solo sounds thin
- need to develop more discrete licks
- Logic recording and playing loops is still not very clear. Weird app @Apple. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:**

**What comes next:**
- go through synced audio, figure out what goes into part 2 and what stays in part 1.
