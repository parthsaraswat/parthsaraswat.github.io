### Writing

**What I did:** 
- wrote out new post about new vision for website

**What comes next:**
- release tomorrow

**What I learnt:**
- on posts like this, typing out the whole thing rather than relying on outlines might be a good idea. Takes less time, and I'm not too worried about wording or editing either

**What I struggled with:**
- simply getting started. My (useless) screentime has never been good, but now that I'm trying to do these things again, I realise how much watching YouTube keeps me from just getting started

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- edit episode 17

**What comes next:**
- finalize edit tomorrow and schedule upload

**What I learnt:**
- varispeed shortcut was a _great_ addition. Helps in making tiny adjustments in real speed and then speeding up when listening to the remainder of the episode

**What I struggled with:**
- I put in about an hour each of podcast editing + writing, etc. I get enough done, but i bet the quality could get better if I spent more time and was more intentional.
