### Writing

**What I did:** 
- sketched out the post

**What comes next:**
- putting it down in a linear fashion with bullet points. aka, outlining and determining illustrations

**What I learnt:**
- 'mind mapping' is very different from what i've believed it to be. things don't have to be heirarchical at all: that's kind of the point of mind mapping.
- the goal with mind mapping is to link concepts and also establish a background flow to all the elements of your piece
- need to read up more on how some of my favorite creators do this. austin klown, andy hunt, etc all have great ways of doing this.

**What I struggled with:**
- not much, good experience.

### Music

**What I did:**
- recorded main CP, bassline, set of drums for WL 4

**What comes next:**
- have different drum dynamics for different sections: slight changes. here's how:
  - determine separate sections of solo
  - decide the feel of the drums
  - edit your arrangement accordingly
- once arrangement is determined, have CONCRETE SOLO LICK REQUIREMENTS. R mode before L mode!

**What I learnt:**
- [if you simply understand and specify what you're going to do, the implementation is far more rewarding](https://psaraswat.com/general/2020/11/13/side-proj.html) ;)

**What I struggled with:**
- logic pro mishaps. couple of crashes, but more importantly: running into problems with some stupid issues. cell length keeps changing on me, and I still can't figure out certain recording inconveniences. need to rewatch some tutorials. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- ep 7 is edited and uploaded. release on thursday night. 

**What comes next:**
- social post + start ep 9 edit

**What I learnt:**
- adding chapters and templating certain things to reduce overheads.
