### Writing
**What I did:** 
- finished editing the post!

**What comes next:**
- illustrations. There's 5, and I think I can knock those out as soon as tomorrow. New post on Tuesday!

**What I struggled with:**
- editing sucks when the raw material isn't good. Here's some ideas on making the raw material better:
1. Trust the writing process and don't begin typing until you have a concrete flow ready. Right brain work first, left brain work second. 
2. Get rid of the 'I's in your writing. Revisiting [Adam Ragusea's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZuAjUUa8rE) on writing could be helpful. 
3. [Avoid adding fluff to your writing!](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2019/04/delete-words-phrases/)

### Music
**What I did:**
- proper structure!!!! So much fun. 

**What comes next:**
- put structure into Logic and decide out of available options with some experimentation

**What I learnt:**
- there is so much value in breaking down and analysing things you like. A lot of the ideas for this arrangement are coming out of analysing 2 or 3 of my favs and noticing what it is i like about them

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- More editing. Sectioned out episode 3

**What comes next:**
- Go into each section, clean it up, piece them together

**What I learnt:**
- Broad strokes first, fine strokes second: sectioning out the entire conversation means you can compartmentalize and attack each section in pieces
- A lot of insight to take back when recording. Maybe be more aware of bits that could become cold opens? Even though the entire conversation is spontaneous, it follows a certain structure: catching up/warming up, topic introduction, actual topic, TLDR, cool down, outro. Try to think of which section you are in when recording.

**What I struggled with:**
- Not knowing keyboard shortcuts to frequently used operations in Logic. Need to add some custom shortcuts too. 

### Other
**What I did:**
- Classic Sunday weekly planning
