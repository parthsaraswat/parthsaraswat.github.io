## Announcement!

I just released a new podcast I have been working on with my friend! We are super excited about it, and you can find the first episode and trailer [here](http://frndshiptime.com)!

A good way to start the year.

### Writing

**What I did:**
- Typed out the outline for the next post (it's about everything I learnt from 7 months of blogging)

**What comes next:**
- A first finished draft of the post ready for editing
- start on illustrations for the post

**What I struggled with:**
- Usually I've been quite good about having a good flow between sections of a post. I've also been good with finishing conceptualization and linking before I actually start writing. This post was written haphazardly and over a lot of travelling and over a holiday break, so things were a bit rickety. For the next post, I will work through my steps a little more rather than just winging it. 

### Music

**What I did:**
- Arrangement work. I'd been struggling with nailing down a rhythm with a warm, soft tone but I think I finally have it. At least I have version 1.

**What comes next:**
- Record the entire fingerpicking track
- Add a second EG track

**What I struggled with:**
- Timing! Playing to a metronome is much easier said than done. 

### Podcast
**What I did:**
- Launch day!

**What comes next:**
- Working out recording schedules with a 13.5hr time difference. Not fun.
- Edit episode 3

### Other
**What I did:**
- Nothing. Yay. 

**What comes next:**
- Some conception and continue to record RLF
