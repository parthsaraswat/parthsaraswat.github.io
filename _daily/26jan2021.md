### Music

**What I did:**
- recorded a 2nd guitar track and some ensemble vsts
- arranged wl3

**What comes next:**
- creating scenes according to proposed arrangement

**What I struggled with:**
- Logic Pro had some real _bruh_ moments today. About 12 crashes and lost an hour's worth of work. Nothing I can do there. Just sad. Save your work often, kids!
