### Writing
**What I did:**

- start putting together post 1

**What I struggled with:**

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- planned out all episodes until end of year

- 

**What I struggled with:**

### Technical
**What I did:**
- read through Functions section of Clean Code
- (hopefully) found a way to safely use Cpptools on a big codebase

**What comes next:**
- keep an eye out for cognitive breaks when coding
- if there is a cognitive break, it is likely that the code could be made simpler and cleaner
- any future functions written should follow the Clean Code function guidelines
- build your own clang format config file for easier formatting

### Content I consumed
#### DevTea episodes
  1. Bowl of Mediocrity
    - parabolic graph. y-axis learning and growth, x-axis level of discomfort
    - lower end - you know nothing so you learn a lot, low discomfort
    - upper end - you learn a lot from new experiences, lots of discomfort
  2. 4 Qs to ask yourself about your career
  3. Compounding your time
    - the idea that the work you put in now should help you compound your time returns tomorrow
    - spend time learning things that will benefit tomorrow a lot
    - spending time doing linear things promises linear returns
##### How to apply
1. take on expanded responsibilities and techincally difficult assignments *especially* if they are out of comfort zone
2. added to list of 'activities' i have to complete in addition to DYL activities
3. automate processes - do an audit on processes for podcasting, writing etc. Also focus real time on learning and improving tech-wise. Checklist prod is one thing - craft improvement is the way to compound your time.
