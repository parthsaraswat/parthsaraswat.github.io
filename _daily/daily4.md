### What I did:

A bunch of admin work that was important, urgent, and mindnumbingly boring. Other exciting things:

#### Writing
- Successful recording session on a [secret project](http://frndshiptime.com) I'm working on with a friend 

#### Other
- Set up a Discord server I have big plans for. Exciting! I will open up the invite link to the public soon. :)
- Posts are finally sorted correctly on the [daily dispatch!](/daily-dispatch). Special thanks to my friends [Ratik](http://ratiksharma.com) and [Aadway!](http://instagram.com/aadway)
