Napped for 5 hours. It was great. And then did nothing else. It was fantastic. 10/10. That being said, I'm a big fan of [non-zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/), so here's some stuff anyway:

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- released episode 7:

**What comes next:**
- record ep 10
- edit ep 9

### Music

**What I did:**
- one single VST added (this week was all about constraint, so no more than 1 vst allowed)

**What comes next:**
- same as yday
