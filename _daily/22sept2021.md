Weekend Wednesday so not too much work time. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
  - updated descriptions for 35p2
  - finished social media post for 35p2
**What comes next:**
  - 37 concept
  - push for Qs ep 39
**What I learnt:**
 - *Conceptualization*
   - I'm definitely coming up with better, more 'show-like' ideas these days
   - taking these ideas and turning them into real episodes is more involved than simply turning on a mic and setup and start talking
   - that's a sign of having a not-so-standard idea. The setup in order to record the episode is more involved. Eg: guest episodes, QnA, things I have planned for ep 41 onwards.
 - *Editing*
   - using delete and move might be quocker than using Shift+F
