### What I did:

#### Writing
There are 2 posts scheduled to come out in the next 2 weeks. I spent some time thinknig about what each post was going to be. I had the idea in my head and a basic seed of the content, but today was about [populating the idea more](https://psaraswat.com/general/2020/08/27/writing-process.html).

#### Music
Just some basic harmonic analysis. Not a lot to share when most of the work was theory.

#### Other
I have a few ideas for how I want to bring my YouTube channel back. Today was about exploring those ideas and trying one of them out.

#### What I struggled with:
I've been good with practicing music the past few weeks but I just couldn't bring myself to do it today. Oh well.
