### Writing
**What I did:** 
- Finished draft 1! It is... okay. Lots of run on sentences and needs editing. 

**What comes next:**
- Some serious editing. I've been lazy with editing in the past, but I think doing it for real is going to help me become a much better writer.
- Illustrations

### Music

**What I did:**
- More arrangement work. I was supposed to record to a track but I'll probably refocus on building a good arrangement
- Lots of experimentation with the right tones for 2 supporting tracks (I think I have something I like now)

**What comes next:**
- Desparately need a **proper piece structure**. Performances and final tracking will come later, but structure -> better arrangement ideas (not subject to change later!)
- Just dipping toes into production now. Cannot jump in without finishing structure and some basic V1 and C arrangement

**What I struggled with:**
- Music is fun because I can allow myself to get carried away. It's fun! I might not do what I was 'supposed to' but I do make progress in some direction. Maybe fix one thing that must be done in addition to allowing room for experimentation?

### [Podcast (Frndship Time)](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:**
- Edited the first 5 mins of episode 3 - the entire intro

**What comes next:**
- More editing

**What I struggled with and learnt:**
- This is only my second podcast episode edit. I thought I had my pod edit process all figured out but after a frustrating 20 mins of struggling with Logic Pro features, I turned to a simpler process that worked a lot better.
- As these episodes are 'one off' edits, there is no need to have an 'efficient' process if it comes at the cost of clunkiness. The lightweight process works faster, and with better raw material going in, future episodes will hopefully be even easier to edit.

### Other

**What I did:**
- Some text based storyboarding for an upcoming project\
