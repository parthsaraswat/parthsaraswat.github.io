Seems only fitting for me to have an update on April fool's day. 

### Music
I'm still nursing a hand injury and have been unable to do much musically... oops

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- episode 13 is up!

**What comes next:**
- need to plan ep 17
- the idea of 'fleshing out' the conversation using audio cues is interesting. I'm going to listen to some more Freakonomics Radio and Ear Hustle to copy some of their techniques.

**What I learnt:**
- episode 13 had a bunch of firsts: the first 'guest', the first time I used some audio cues to flesh out the story
- if recording using Zoom, ensure you record each guest on their separate track. We recorded ep 13 in a very ad-hoc way and overlooked this. The edit was fairly painless but could have been much smoother had I kept this tip in mind.
