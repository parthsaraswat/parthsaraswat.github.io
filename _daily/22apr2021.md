### Writing

**What I did:** 
- release [new strat for blog post](https://psaraswat.com/general/2021/04/22/newstrat.html)
- chart out next month of content

**What comes next:**
- release plans for next month of conten over the weekend

**What I learnt:**
- it could be useful to automate some of the final writing process

**What I struggled with:**
- my Jekyll compile is broken. I'm also considering a facelift for the site and head over to an easily hosted website  

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- short edit to finish up episode 17

**What comes next:**
- extract bonus ep and tip up ep 17
- upload 17

**What I learnt:**
- finishing up an edit early is useful. I almost messed up big time and we almost weren't able to make ep16 on time, but having ep17 edited and ready in the backpocket was useful as a cover up.
