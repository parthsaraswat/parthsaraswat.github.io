### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- edited, uploaded and scheduled episode 17

**What comes next:**
- edit the bonus episode
- what is ep 21 going to be? i have a front runner, but will not reveal it in case Ratik is reading this

**What I learnt:**
- A always B be C closing ALWAYS BE CLOSING
- there is so much more delight in _finishing_ something than it being 'nearly' finished
- simply being able to say 'yes that is done' requires a bigger effort than making 'great progress' and being nearly there
