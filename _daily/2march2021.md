### Writing
**What comes next:**

### Music
**What I did:**
- normal practice routine
- arranging + recording entirety of WL5!

**What comes next:**
- final mix for WL5 (thursday)
- FSheet for WL5
- improv with some more context: what chords are we playing over? What notes should I choose? Some patterns to find notes quickly

**What I learnt:**
- practice in playing = less frustration while recording. 

**What I struggled with:**
- note choice during improv and falling back into 'shape prison'
