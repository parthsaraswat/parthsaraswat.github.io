### Writing

**What I did:** 
- finished the [new post, it's up now!](https://psaraswat.com/general/2021/01/05/05-what-learnt-blogging.html)

**What comes next:**
- i have 2 posts underway. they're in very initial stages
- put the new post and podcast episode into the newsletter and ship it

**What I learnt:**
- tools are important. I wasn't very keen on illustrations for some of my previous posts because they were such a chore to make. With the right tools (software + hardware), illustrations are now so much fun. Expect many more in future posts!

### Music

**What I did:**
- rearrangement. what seemed *nice* yesterday wasn't as nice as what i have now. the magic of iteration!
- new rhythm for sections

**What comes next:**
- performances and tracking. coming up with ideas is glamorous but playing them to a tick is not easy
- concrete rhythm guitar section
- same followups as yesterday

**What I struggled with:**
- not doing anything i laid out yday, but that's okay: progress was made anyway. 

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- the edit is done!!!

**What comes next:**
- final clean up on audio. might take an hour, tops. 
- recording episode 5

**What I struggled with:**
- not much! the last bits of episode 3 were easy to edit. the raw recording was quite easy to work with.

**What I learnt:**
- over the entirety of the edit, the new process developed and now I feel much more comfortable with a longer edit. maybe a post about an 'initial editing process' in the next few weeks? who knows.
- channel strip settings in Logic. useful for repeatable edits. simply grab a channel strip settings and throw them onto another project for reliable, repeatable, consistent audio quality. no time or thinking, just drag and drop.

### Other

**What I did:**
- err....

**What comes next:**
- fill out visual storytelling plan
