## Happy 2nd weekend of the year!

Here's everything I've been working on this weekend:

### Writing

**What I did:** 
- mind mapped next post
- outlined post
- wrote first draft (wow! did not expect to have all this done)

**What comes next:**
- edit
- illustrations

**What I struggled with:**
- im about to restart my youtube channel and i now also have a podcast. it is tough to find what topic is best suited for which platform now. should this be a video? should it be a podcast topic? can it be all of the above? right now, I am experimenting with taking one idea and exploring it in different ways on each platform.

### Music
**What I did:**

**What I struggled with:**

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)

**What I did:** 
- recorded episode 5

**What comes next:**
- editing episode 5. using tricks i picked up last week and [these tricks](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/09/18/editing-podcasts-logic-pro-x/)

**What I struggled with:**
- internet + recording setup is janky. today we had to prioritize recording quality over good internet, by next week I want to have both. Move router? Record at a different time? Different location? Who knows. 

### Other

**What I did:**
- took an existing idea for a project and adapted it for a certain application
**What comes next:**
- shot lists
- talking points outline
**What I struggled with:**
