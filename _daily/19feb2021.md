This is a great way for me to personally keep track of what I've learnt and done over time, but I don't think it needs to go online every day. Maybe a weekly edition would make more sense. No more daily dispatch this next week!

### Music
**What I did:**
- wl4 arrangement is done
- started a guitar practice session with some Co5's arpeggios

**What comes next:**
- wl4 mix
- speed up practice, add rhythm exercises

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- lots of editing. ep9 is turning out ot be a bit of a monster, but working out not too badly

**What comes next:**
- cut out extra bits, polish up remaining ones

**What I learnt:**
- adding keyboard shortcuts in Logic Pro. Add a shortcut for delete and move, everybody!
