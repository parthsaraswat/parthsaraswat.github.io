### Other
**What I did:**
- back to daily dispatch

**What comes next:**

**What I learnt:**
- these posts are the best way for me to keep track of everything I'm learning. When I don't do these, I keep learning things but without documentation I forget them and repeat the same mistakes. End up in a spin.
