Long time, no see. We are back in business. 

### Music
**What I did:**
- signed up for some 'formalised' knowledge based training

**What comes next:**
- had some technical issues w/ peripherals. Fix.
- get back to analysis and spec for WL6

### [Podcast](http://frndshiptime.com)
**What I did:** 
- started editing episode 13. This is going to be special! Lots of new ideas and experimentation. 

**What comes next:**
- continue to edit sectors of the episode. 

**What I learnt:**
- the best way to try new ideas out is to not give much thought. If an idea seems cool, just do it. If it doesn't work, revert. There's no pressure. But if it does work, jackpot.
