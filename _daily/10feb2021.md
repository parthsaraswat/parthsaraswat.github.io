### Writing

**What I did:** 
- outlining. but not so much

**What comes next:**
- finish outlining

**What I learnt:**
- sometimes just more fun to work on things that are flowing rather than what 'i was supposed to do'

### Music

**What I did:**
- drum machining for WL4. coming together very nicely, probably my favorite so far. who knew practice made better?
- solo sectioning

**What comes next:**
- polishing up some tracks
- starting on solo tone and tracks 

**What I learnt:**
- so much about song dynamics and drum machines
  - songs are just like any other piece of creative work
  - there are 'acts'
  - your instruments determine the height of these acts. Play it just right and it'll all line up to make the feel right. 

### Other

**What I did:**
- i don't talk much about technical stuff here but lots of things learnt in the coding world today
- learning tricks in the good old text editor

**What comes next:**
- scripting exercises and deconstructing existing scripts
