### Catch up
- Missed a lot from last week: here's the roundup:
  - [Episode 5](https://frndshiptime.com) of the podcast is out!
  - Episode 6, 7, 8 recorded
  - Editing episode 7 - maybe one more day until i finish. Due next thursday.
  - Recorded a football-related podcast episode: For The Love Of! I will post a link when the episode is out. Thanks for having me, Noel :)
  - Logic Pro has been an absolute pain, and WL3 has been delayed
    - this might just be because WL3 turned into a HUGE project with 35+ solo takes. Not... great for the processor. 
  - changing weekly loops to biweekly loops. Gives me more time to make and record a solo. The end goal is to make better music, not find quicker ways of making loops of the same quality.
