### What I did:

#### Writing
Considering a series of posts along a similar theme. We shall see.

#### Music
Trying to learn a song by ear. Also really challenging vocals for me. I always start with a feel for how much I enjoy the song and then record bits and pieces on my voicenotes app before doing anything real. Here's the voicenote from today!

#### Technical
Trying to figure out a lightweight, easy way to add subscription support to the website so people can be notified whenever new posts come out. Here's a whiteboard session I had with a friend

#### Discord
Created a plan for what I want my discord to act like. Implementation is underway... first version to be done this week!
