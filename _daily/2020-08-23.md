### What I did:

#### Logistics

Sundays are for logistics. I redid my entire project management system and got cleaned out some templates that help me with writing, music production and other projects.

#### Discord

I'm working on a Discord server that enhances how I interact with my friends and friends online. I hope to have a post regarding the plan etc up in the next few weeks!
