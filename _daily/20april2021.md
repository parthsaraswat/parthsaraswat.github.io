- mind dumping the next 'classic' post

**What comes next:**
- writing out final post
- content calender for May 2021

**What I learnt:**
- commit! commit to stages of projects. As soon as you call something finished/done enough to move on, you're able to move to the other equally crucial pieces of a project or task
- if you don't commit, you get stuck refining a certain stage of the project/task and don't actually make any movement

**What I did:** 
- Sectioned out ep 17
- Set up new keyboard shortcuts for fast movement and Varispeed toggling

**What comes next:**
- clean up sections of the episode
